# Peets4Knights

Currently, Calvin students find themselves waiting long periods of time in line to order and receive drinks from Peets Café. This is amplified during busy hours such as after chapel. Our group is creating a solution allowing students to order from Peets ahead of time and give them an estimate pickup time. Our app would bring value to Calvin students who are in more of a time crunch and do not have the extra time to wait in line. The app in question would be titled “Peets for Knights”. This process could also allow for staff to make drinks faster. They would have the opportunity to spend less time taking orders and more time making drinks which in turn would speed up the process for all involved.
Right now, students have no option to ordering before arriving at Peets. Many other establishments such as Starbucks have already implemented an app to order ahead of time. However, at Peets, all students are required to wait in line to be served increasing wait times. Ordering before arriving would add benefit to students in a rush and optimize the speed at which Peets coffee can operate. The app would clearly display drink options and give customers an estimated wait time for their drink depending on the traffic at the Café. In the app users would have the ability to customize their drink order. Payments options could be added in the future for students convience.
