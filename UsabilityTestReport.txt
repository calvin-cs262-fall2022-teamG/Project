Usability Test Report
12/2/22
User tests are essential to figuring out how applications function in the hands of the target audience for an app. Peets4Knights ran usability tests on the functionality of their application to better understand developmental flaws in the applaicaon.
Users were asked to complete tasks in the app including logging in, ordering drinks, and managing their current orders. Through testing, it was found that the login screen buttons only acted when the text inside each box was pressed. Fixing the issue will require changing the button to fill the whole space of the text input instead of the text itself. When ordering drinks users found that the scrollable menu was easy to navigate but was too long. By creating more rows Peets4Knights was able to divide up the menu by types of items creating an easier-to-view menu. 
Some users commented that the navigation was undetailed due to the smaller labels on the bottom tabs of the screen. To address the text flaw, Peets4Knights plans to enlarge the text and change the active screen indicator to add clarity for users. When managing orders, it was discovered that removing individual items was not intuitive since it does require swiping on each drink. Adding some icons or text to the cart page would allow users to not struggle with removing drinks in the future. Most users vocalized that the application had an easy-to-understand and intuitive design. However, some of the UI could be more visually appealing. Before deployment Peets4Knights plans to change fonts and colors for a more modern look. 
Overall, Peets4Knights learned that usability of the app could become simplified with some simple fixes to buttons, labels, and styles.
